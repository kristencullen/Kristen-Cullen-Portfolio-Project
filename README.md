## Introduction
### The module 2 challenge focuses on showcasing my skills using CSS by creating a Professional Portfolio. In this challenge, I was able to practice using various CSS features such as padding, flexboxes, and margins. I was able to do this by creating a new Directory, opening the directory in CS Code, using HTML & CSS to design my webpage, and deploying the webpage on to GitHub.
