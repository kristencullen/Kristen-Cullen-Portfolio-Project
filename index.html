            <p1>I am currently working as a Hospitality Recruiter based in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Additionally, I am in the process of obtaining a full-stack coding certificate from SMUâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. I graduated from Texas Christian University in 2021, with a B.A in Communication Studies. As a Communication studies major, I was able to gain a better understanding of how we communicate and different communication styles. This has helped me with my public speaking skills and create professional relationships efficiently. In my freetime, I enjoy traveling, tyring new reastaurants, and spending time with loved ones.</p1>
